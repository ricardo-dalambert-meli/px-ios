/// The basic `SortFunction`. Use this sort function if you want to animate in all views at the same time and give an `interObjectDelay` of `0.0`. Note that this `SortFunction` will animate the views based on the order they were added to the animation view. This means that the way the views are sorted in the `subviews` array is the way that they will be sorted by this `SortFunction`.
